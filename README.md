# React Learning Exercises

A collection of progressive React exercises designed to help beginners learn React concepts step by step using TypeScript and Vite.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Navigation

The project includes a navigation system that allows you to switch between exercises. Each exercise is isolated, making it easier to focus on specific concepts.

## Project Structure

## Learning Path

Each exercise is designed to be completed in order, as they build upon concepts from previous exercises. Students should:

1. Read the comments in each exercise file to understand the learning objectives
2. Attempt to complete the exercise requirements
3. Test their implementation
4. Move on to the next exercise once comfortable with the current concepts
